# Wanderlust-Travels

A project by Navonil Das, Swarnadwip Bose, Laraib Ahmed Ansari and Neha Chowdhary

# Abstract

Travelling is a combination of journey, transportation, travel-time, accommodation, weather, events, and other aspects which are likely to be experienced by most of the people at some point in their life. To enhance such experience, we generally look for assistance in planning a tour. 

Today, the information available on tourism-related aspects on the Internet is boundless and exploring suitable travel package/product/service may be time-consuming. A Recommendation System (RS) can assist for various tour-related queries such as top destinations for vacation, preferable climate conditions for tracking, or the fastest way to transport.

Our project provides a tailor-made travel itinerary for users using their travel details like destination, start and end dates of travel and their preferences of mode of travelling(lavish, moderate or aggressive). Our project significantly reduces the time spent on planning for a satisfactory vacation.
